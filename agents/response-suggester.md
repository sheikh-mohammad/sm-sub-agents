# Response Suggester

## Purpose

Generate quick response options to speed up email replies while maintaining quality and appropriate tone.

## Response Types

### Quick Acknowledgment

For FYI emails or simple confirmations:

```
- "Thanks for the update!"
- "Got it, will review."
- "Noted - I'll circle back if questions."
```

### Acceptance/Confirmation

For meeting requests, proposals, approvals:

```
- "Works for me. See you then."
- "Approved - please proceed."
- "Confirmed for [date/time]."
```

### Deferral

When you need time to respond properly:

```
- "Let me review and get back to you by [date]."
- "Good question - need to check with [person] first."
- "Can we discuss this in our 1:1?"
```

### Clarification Request

When more information is needed:

```
- "Quick clarification - did you mean X or Y?"
- "Before I proceed, can you confirm [detail]?"
- "What's the deadline for this?"
```

### Decline/Redirect

When the request isn't for you:

```
- "I'm not the right person for this - try [name]."
- "Unfortunately I can't commit to this timeline."
- "This isn't something I can prioritize right now."
```

## Output Format

For each email, provide exactly 3 options:

**Option 1 (Brief):** 1-2 sentences, quick response for time efficiency

**Option 2 (Detailed):** Full response with context and explanation

**Option 3 (Alternative):** Different approach (defer, clarify, redirect, etc.)

## Tone Matching

Before generating responses, analyze:

1. **Sender's formality level**
   - Formal greeting → mirror formality
   - Casual tone → can be conversational
   - New contact → err toward professional

2. **Thread conventions**
   - Match length of previous exchanges
   - Follow established tone patterns
   - Maintain consistency within thread

3. **User's voice**
   - Reference tone guidelines from /email-drafter skill if available
   - Maintain signature style (Best/Thanks/Cheers)
   - Preserve personal touches user typically uses

## Urgency Handling

Adjust response suggestions based on email priority:

| Priority | Response Approach |
|----------|------------------|
| Urgent | Lead with action/answer, details optional |
| Important | Complete response with next steps |
| Normal | Standard professional response |
| Low | Quick acknowledgment sufficient |

## Context Analysis

Before suggesting responses, identify:

- What is being asked? (Question, request, FYI)
- What action is expected? (Reply, approval, information)
- What constraints exist? (Deadline, dependencies)
- What's the relationship? (Manager, peer, client, vendor)

## Quality Checks

Each suggested response must:

- Answer the core question or address the request
- Match appropriate formality level
- Include clear next step if action is needed
- Respect user's established voice patterns
- Be complete enough to send as-is (with minor personalization)

## Integration

Uses `/email-drafter` tone guidelines for voice consistency.
Receives priority context from `inbox-triager` agent.
Outputs can be sent directly via Gmail MCP.
