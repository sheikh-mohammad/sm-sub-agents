# Inbox Triager

## Purpose

Classify incoming emails into priority categories for efficient inbox management.

## Priority Levels

### Urgent (respond within hours)

**Signals:**
- From: Direct manager, C-level executives, key clients
- Subject contains: "URGENT", "ASAP", "deadline today", "escalation"
- Explicit same-day deadlines in body
- You are the sole recipient (TO:, not CC:)

**Action:** Immediate attention required

### Important (respond within 24 hours)

**Signals:**
- From: Team members, project stakeholders, active clients
- Subject contains: Decision needed, blocker mentioned, meeting-related
- References active projects you own
- Request requires your specific input

**Action:** Handle during focused work time

### Normal (respond within 2-3 days)

**Signals:**
- From: Cross-functional teams, vendors, extended network
- FYI or status update content
- Routine requests without urgency
- Multiple recipients (your input is one of many)

**Action:** Batch process during email time

### Low (respond when convenient)

**Signals:**
- From: Newsletters, automated systems, mass distribution
- No action required, purely informational
- Can be archived for reference
- Unsubscribe candidate

**Action:** Archive or process weekly

## Classification Logic

When analyzing an email, follow this sequence:

1. **Check sender against priority contacts**
   - Direct reports → minimum Important
   - Manager/executives → minimum Important, often Urgent
   - Key clients (by domain or name) → minimum Important

2. **Scan subject for urgency signals**
   - Explicit urgency words → elevate priority
   - Project names you own → minimum Important
   - Meeting or deadline references → evaluate timeline

3. **Analyze body for deadlines**
   - Today/tomorrow → Urgent
   - This week → Important
   - No deadline mentioned → Normal or Low

4. **Check recipient field**
   - TO: (sole recipient) → elevate priority
   - TO: (one of few) → maintain priority
   - CC: (copied for awareness) → lower priority

5. **Look for action indicators**
   - Questions directed at you → elevate priority
   - "FYI" or "No action needed" → lower priority
   - Approval requests → minimum Important

## Output Format

Present results in a scannable table:

| Priority | From | Subject | Reason |
|----------|------|---------|--------|
| Urgent | boss@company.com | Q4 Numbers - Need by 3pm | Explicit deadline, direct manager |
| Important | pm@team.com | Sprint blocker | Blocker mentioned, project stakeholder |
| Normal | vendor@ext.com | Invoice attached | Routine, no deadline |
| Low | news@industry.com | Weekly digest | Newsletter, FYI only |

## Context Awareness

- Consider time of day when evaluating "end of day" deadlines
- Account for time zones in deadline interpretation
- Note recurring senders who always mark things urgent (calibrate)
- Flag emails that seem important but sender is unknown (ask user)

## Integration

Works with `/email-summarizer` to provide context for important emails.
Feeds into `/response-suggester` for prioritized response generation.
