# Follow-Up Tracker

## Purpose

Ensure no sent emails fall through the cracks by tracking expected response times and alerting when follow-up is needed.

## Deadline Detection

### Explicit Deadlines

Direct mentions of dates or times:

- "Please respond by Friday"
- "Need this by EOD"
- "Deadline: March 15"
- "Before our meeting on Tuesday"

### Implicit Deadlines

Context-based urgency without explicit dates:

| Email Type | Implicit Deadline |
|------------|-------------------|
| Meeting-related | Before meeting date |
| Proposal sent | 5-7 business days |
| First outreach | 7 days |
| Second follow-up | 14 days from first |
| Urgent request | 24-48 hours |
| Partnership inquiry | 10-14 days |

### No Follow-Up Needed

Recognize when tracking isn't required:

- FYI or informational emails
- Emails explicitly marked "no reply needed"
- Thank you or closing messages
- Automated notifications
- Emails where you're CC'd

## Follow-Up Schedule

Recommended timing based on email type:

| Email Type | First Follow-Up | Second Follow-Up | Final |
|------------|----------------|------------------|-------|
| Cold outreach | Day 7 | Day 14 | Day 21 |
| Warm intro | Day 5 | Day 10 | Day 15 |
| Proposal | Day 5 | Day 10 | Day 14 |
| Meeting request | Day 3 | Day 7 | Day 10 |
| Urgent request | Day 2 | Day 4 | Day 7 |
| Internal team | Day 3 | Day 7 | - |

## Tracking Logic

When analyzing sent emails:

1. **Identify email type** from subject and content
2. **Extract explicit deadlines** if present
3. **Calculate implicit deadline** based on email type
4. **Check for responses** in inbox
5. **Determine follow-up status**:
   - Overdue (past deadline, no response)
   - Due today (deadline is today)
   - Due soon (within 2 days)
   - On track (before deadline)
   - Resolved (response received)

## Output Format

Present tracking status in actionable format:

| Email | Sent | Follow-Up Due | Status |
|-------|------|---------------|--------|
| Partnership proposal to Marcus | Dec 20 | Dec 27 | ⚠️ Due today |
| Meeting request to Sarah | Dec 23 | Dec 28 | ⏰ Due in 1 day |
| Cold outreach to Alex | Dec 15 | Dec 22 | ❌ Overdue (5 days) |
| Quarterly update to team | Dec 24 | - | ✅ No follow-up needed |

## Actions

For each tracked email, suggest:

- **Overdue**: Generate follow-up email using /email-templates
- **Due today**: Prioritize in today's task list
- **Due soon**: Schedule for upcoming follow-up
- **Resolved**: Mark as closed, remove from tracking

## Response Detection

Identify when email has been answered:

- Direct reply in inbox (same thread)
- Response from any recipient (not just TO:)
- Meeting scheduled (for meeting requests)
- Action taken (for approval requests)

Mark as "Closed - [response type]" when detected.

## Weekly Summary

Generate weekly overview:

```
Follow-Up Summary (Week of Dec 22)

Overdue (need immediate attention): 2
Due this week: 5
On track: 8
Closed this week: 12

Top priority follow-ups:
1. Partnership proposal to Marcus (overdue 5 days)
2. Meeting request to Sarah (due tomorrow)
```

## Integration

Uses Gmail MCP to scan sent folder and inbox.
Triggers `/email-templates follow-up` for follow-up drafting.
